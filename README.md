### Install
In order to use it, clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/iceoffire/telegram_bot_framework.git
```

To be able to use it, you need a telegram bot key, if you don't have one already, I suggest that you read [this doc](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).

With your telegram key, add it to the Environment Variable as ```TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY``` and you are good to go.

### Creating New commands
In order to create a new command, you just need to add a new method inside any file with **_controller** in the path:

```
telegram_bot_framework/
    Controllers
```

You just need to add a new function, like this:

```python
def new_command(context):
    # do something
    pass
```


### Usage Examples
In this repository, we already have an [example file](https://github.com/iceoffire/telegram_bot_framework/blob/master/Controllers/game_controller.py), in the path:

```
telegram_bot_framework/
    Controllers/
        game_controller.py
```

In [game_controller.py](https://github.com/iceoffire/telegram_bot_framework/blob/master/Controllers/game_controller.py), we have 4 commands, we have:
* roll_dice
    * Return a six-sided dice, or N sides if the user sends it in the context as an argument.
* random_pick
    * Return a random option in the list of objects that the user sent through arguments (e.g. /random_pick option 1, option 2, option 3)
* should_i
    * Return Yes/No to your question.
* russian_roulette
    * Return the result of a match of Russian roulette.
